# SystemTesting
The system was created from a combination of projects :
1) https://github.com/imarkiew/Fuzzy-Pattern-Classifier - The system is based on the modified Soren algorithm implemented in Python 3.6
2) https://github.com/imarkiew/Fuzzy-Models-Comparing - System with Chi and Ishibuchi & Nakashima reference algorithms from R language 

The system has the task of testing all algorithms together, which was done by taking the initial data processing from 1)
to the main test loop written in the script language of the Bash shell.
